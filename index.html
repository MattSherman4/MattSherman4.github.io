      <h2>Scouting Quarterbacks by Scouting their Wide Recievers - Jan. 27, 2023</h2>
      
      <p>
        This project explores the influence that wide receivers have on college quarterbacks. While recpetion shares are often
        overlooked, this project uncovers a statistic that is increadibly useful in narrowing down the field of draftable quarterbacks, 
        allowing NFL teams to determine which quarterback will fit best with their already established recieving corps, which quarterbacks
        were carried by their WRs in college, and which quarterbacks spread the ball too much, missing oppertunities to get the ball
        into the hands of their greatest playmakers.
        This project can be seen as an expansion on section 1 of <a href="https://mattsherman4.github.io/QuarterbacksMatthewSherman.html">The Data Science of Quarterback Souting</a>.
        Includes <a href="https://mattsherman4.github.io/QBsByWRsCharts.pdf"><strong>2</strong></a> charts.
