    <br>&emsp;This project explores the influence that wide receivers have on college quarterbacks. While recpetion shares are often
    <br>&emsp;overlooked, this project uncovers a statistic that is increadibly useful in narrowing down the field of draftable quarterbacks, 
    <br>&emsp;allowing NFL teams to determine which quarterback will fit best with their already established recieving corps, which quarterbacks
    <br>&emsp;were carried by their WRs in college, and which quarterbacks spread the ball too much, missing oppertunities to get the ball
    <br>&emsp;into the hands of their greatest playmakers.
    <br>&emsp;This project can be seen as an expansion on section 1 of <a href="https://mattsherman4.github.io/QuarterbacksMatthewSherman.html">The Data Science of Quarterback Souting</a>.
