<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When looking at data analysis in
sports, there is a spike in the usage of ‘next gen statistics’ after the
Oakland A’s Moneyball era in baseball. While teams like the A’s and Red Sox
began a race to spend their money as efficiently as possible through the
practice of data science, professional teams outside the MLB are much slower to
the punch. In fact, data analysis still has a ton of room to grow within the
NFL. Take a look at this chart via Seth Walder (@sethwalder): <img width=696
height=301 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image001.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of the roughly 100 names and positions listed, the word
‘scout’ is only used twice. While it is nearly certain that more than just two
of these people work in their team’s college scouting department, it is
impossible to not wonder how much more success some teams could have if they had
a person dedicated to the data analysis side of college scouting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:200%'>­­       </span>Since
the year 2000, 279 draft picks have been spent on quarterbacks. Of those
selected, 66 were first round picks. Despite this, only 13 unique starting
quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl in this same time frame, making the
position the most difficult to draft by far. In a league with an ever-growing
passing presence, drafting the correct quarterback at the correct time can be a
job saving decision for hundreds of employees in NFL scouting, managing, and
coaching departments. With such a low success rate, the question with the most
sought-after answer league wide is always “how can we find a Super Bowl winning
quarterback.” Data analysis can be used to help narrow the field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:200%'>Scouting
QBs by Scouting WRs</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            An argument often heard when discussing any sport
is that player X is only good because of player Y. Sometimes this argument is
looked back on fondly. For example, the “Bud Dupree was only good in Pittsburgh
because he had TJ Watt playing across from him” crowd would brag after Dupree’s
first year in Tennessee. Alternatively, it was the “Brady is boosted by
Belichick” crowd who was left behind after Brady’s Super Bowl win in Tampa.
While the argument had mixed results in the pros, can it be applied more successfully
in the case of scouting college quarterbacks?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=544
height=414 id="Picture 2"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image002.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The above chart is a histogram
representing the number of wide receivers drafted, grouped by round selected,
per quarterback with a weighted career approximate value (WCAV) (PFR) above 40.
More specifically, for every quarterback with a WCAV greater than 40,
represented is the number of and round(s) selected of their college wide
receivers. For example, Pat Mahomes has a WCAV of roughly 70, and attended
Texas Tech from 2014-2017. During this time, he played with wide receiver Keke
Coutee, who was drafted in the 4<sup>th</sup> round. Therefore, there is a blue
bar of frequency 1 sitting around the 70-mark on the x-axis (it is tucked in
between and behind a few purple bars). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A WCAV cutoff of 40 was chosen to
prevent cluttering of the chart. For perspective, 40 represents the difference
between the career of Robert Griffin III, who scored just below 40, and Baker
Mayfield, who scored just above 40 during his time with the Browns. Given that
this is a career value, very young quarterbacks who haven’t had the opportunity
for multi-year success have not surpassed the cutoff. For further perspective,
some of the youngest quarterbacks with a qualifying WCAV include, but are not
limited to, Pat Mahomes (70), Lamar Jackson (59), Deshaun Watson (52), Josh
Allen (51), Kyler Murray (44), and Baker Mayfield (42).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Furthermore, to ensure that the quarterback
actually played with the wide receiver in college and wasn’t just a backup on
his team when they were together, the wide receiver must have been drafted
within one year of the quarterback. That is, if quarterback X was drafted in
2015, only wide receivers attending their college drafted in 2014-2016 are
considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>So, what does this all mean as far
as drafting a quarterback? Looking at the histogram, there are interesting
trends, particularly surrounding the success of quarterbacks who played with
top tier wide receivers in college. The color green represents wide receivers
selected in round one. The largest bar in the entire graph is green, sitting as
far left as possible. This means that quarterbacks who play with very skilled wide
receivers in college tend to be the least successful of the bunch (remember,
everyone on this list is at least as successful as Baker Mayfield). Were these quarterbacks
over-drafted due to the talent of their wider receiver cores? Interestingly,
the black bar, for wide receivers drafted in round 7, follows a similar trend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>You will also notice a small green
bar to far right of the graph, where Tom Brady lies. Brady, as you know, was a
6<sup>th</sup> round pick, who went to college with a wide receiver who would
end up getting drafted in the 1<sup>st</sup> round, David Terrell. Terrell
would have a rough career, only amassing a WCAV of 11. It’s safe to say that
the scouts of the time got these two mixed up and that Brady should have been
the 1<sup>st</sup> round pick and Terrell the 6<sup>th</sup>, making the purple
instead of green like it shows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Furthermore, you’ll notice that a
majority of the graph consists of bars colored blue, light blue, and purple.
This indicates that most successful quarterbacks in the NFL played with wide
receivers in college who were deemed to have round 4-6 talent. Are these wide
receivers legitimately mid-round talents? Or are they just playing up to that
level due to great quarterback play?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Finally, it is important to note
the 12 quarterbacks who had <i>no</i> college wide receivers drafted. That is,
12 quarterbacks with careers better that Baker Mayfield’s, who didn’t once
throw a competitive ball to an NFL caliber wide receiver until after the NFL
draft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=563 height=367
id="Picture 3"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image003.png">             </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The above graph shows the same trend as the
histogram, but on a scatter plot and including quarterbacks with a WCAV less
than 40. You will notice many of the trends discussed when looking at the
histogram are confirmed here. There are the largest clusters in both of the
bottom corners of the graph, where less successful quarterbacks who played
collegiately with 1<sup>st</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> round wide receivers are
located , as well as in the upper middle, where you see a small cluster of 4
very successful quarterbacks who played with mid-round wide receivers in
college. A trendline on this graph would likely show a slight rainbow shape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There are a few interesting quarterbacks to
monitor over the next few years. Can Kyler Murray (CeeDee Lamb) or Deshaun
Watson (Mike Williams) break this trend? The two show promise but have a
combined 1 playoff win in 8 years played. What about Joe Burrow (Jamar Chase,
Justin Jefferson)? His data point is particularly interesting, as one of the
highly touted wide receivers he played with in college is now on his same NFL
team; a very rare scenario within the league. What about Kenny Pickett (Jordan
Addison?) or CJ Stroud (Garret Wilson, Chris Olave, Jaxon Smith-Njigba?).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            So, what conclusions can ultimately be made
about quarterbacks by looking at their college wide receivers? Here are a few
that stand out to me:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Top tier
college wide receivers (round 1 selections) make quarterbacks appear better
than they are.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The best quarterbacks
will create mid-to-late round (4-6) selections out of their college wide
receiver cores.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>12
qualified quarterbacks had none of their college wide receivers drafted, which
is a trend worthy of further investigation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a result, staying away from quarterbacks who had great wide
receivers during their college careers could increase a team’s odds of hitting
at the position. In their stead, teams should favor quarterbacks who played
with mid-round talent in college. Quarterbacks are difficult to scout. Why not
use the easier-to-scout talent around them to help predict their NFL success? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:200%'>Where
Should You Draft Your quarterback?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The trend for quarterbacks has been consistent
recently; draft them early or don’t draft them at all. In fact, six of the last
eight drafts have seen a quarterback drafted with the first overall pick.
Furthermore, there is serious discussion every single year regarding quarterback-needy
teams trading up from the second round to late in the first in order to get an
extra year on a rookie quarterbacks’ contract, despite them not necessarily
being seen as a first-round prospect. Sports commentators constantly weigh in
on this themselves, with Nick Wright saying “If I was running a team, here’s my
rule for the GM: There are only 2 spots where you’re allowed to draft a
quarterback. In the top 10, or [in the] 6<sup>th</sup> round or later.” on his
show <i>What’s Wright? With Nick Wright</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> With this being said, is there any truth to the idea that
successful quarterbacks need to be drafted so early? Should teams trade up to
pick their franchise quarterbacks?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=588 height=155 id="Picture 4"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image004.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The above heatmap shows where quarterbacks are
selected most in the draft since 2000. As you can see, the first overall pick
is the most popular selection point, while other areas such as 2, 3, 10, and 32
trail closely behind. quarterbacks also seem to be less likely to get picked in
the second round than in any other. In fact, the round totals are as follows:
67, 22, 28, 28, 26, 38, and 43, for rounds 1-7, respectfully. Perhaps this dip
in round 2 is because teams are indeed reaching in round 1 for an extra year on
the contract, leaving a skill void in round 2?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Now that it is known where quarterbacks are
being selected in general, it must be figured out if teams are actually having
success when they trade up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=592 height=158 id="Picture 5"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image005.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The above heatmap shows the average success of quarterbacks
picked at each selection, according to weighted career approximate value (WCAV)
(PFR). quarterbacks selected in the top 12 have some of the best success, all
picks considered. We also see good quarterbacks selected around picks 18, 24,
and 32. The problems with this chart, of course, is that it benefits draft
selections that only have one quarterback selected in them. For example, picks
4 and 24 have the top two scores in the second heatmap, but the first heatmap
exposes them both as averages taken over just one quarterback. Both of the
above heatmaps have their benefits and can be used efficiently, however the
best heatmap would be one consisting of weighted averages, as seen below:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=594 height=169 id="Picture 6"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image006.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            These values are shown using the weighted
average formula: <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
position:relative;top:23.0pt'><img width=91 height=52
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image007.png"></span>.
They aim to give us a more accurate average of the quarterback success per each
pick, taking in to account the amount of quarterbacks selected at each pick.
This is best seen by relooking at picks 4 and 24, which are now overshadowed by
multiple other selections throughout the draft. The evidence is beyond clear
now that the best quarterbacks are taken with the first overall selection. In
fact, the difference between the value at the first selection and at any other
selection is so difficult, that it makes the color differences at any other
pick difficult to see. Despite this, there is still discern that the values at
picks 3, 11, and 32 are all noteworthy. We even see small spikes in round 3 at
pick 11 and in round 7 at pick 7, where Russell Wilson and Tom Brady prove that
it is possible, albeit rare, to hit on a later round quarterback (Brady is
moved to the 7<sup>th</sup> round in this display due to the presence of
compensatory picks, which are not separately labeled in the graphic).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            What can be taken from these heatmaps? First of
all, quarterbacks are taken early, and often in the first round. This is for
good reason, as, generally speaking, the best quarterbacks are taken early in
the draft. The “trade up for pick 32 in order to get an extra contract year”
trope has certainly had its success as well. Furthermore, it is possible to hit
on a quarterback after the first round, although the best quarterbacks are
taken in the top 12 and with pick 32, while the second-tier quarterbacks are
usually picked elsewhere in the first round. While Nick Wright was correct in
his opinion that top-10 selections yield the best quarterbacks, his assertion
is still missing out on a wealth of talent later in the first round. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            All things considered; the following conclusions
can be made based on the above heatmaps:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first
overall pick is indeed the most valuable in the draft (no surprise here).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trading up
for a non-first-overall quarterback when your original selection is in the top
12 is silly, as you are still in the hot zone for tier 1 quarterbacks.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trading up
from picks 13-31 could be beneficial, especially in such a hot quarterback
market. It is not, however, 100% necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pick 32
may well be the second most important selection in the draft. Use it wisely. If
you’re not in the position to select a quarterback, its trade value is much
higher than any draft pick trade chart would have it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Drafting a
quarterback outside of the first round is akin to playing the lottery: Everyone
thinks they’re getting a Russell Wilson, but most end up with a Josh Dobbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately, draft history can play a pretty large role in deciding
present day drafting. While the variations of talent from draft class to draft
class can and should affect one’s draft decisions, the average success by pick
over 20-plus years of drafting should have a considerable effect on a team’s
draft process and selections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:200%'>When
Should You Move On from a Quarterback?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Many in the media argue and debate
over which quarterback should be drafted by which team. You will often hear broadcasters
discuss which players have the most potential, who is the most pro-ready, or
which quarterback fits which scheme the best. However, half a decade after each
draft, when said quarterbacks are ready to get their second NFL deals, the
media always seems to agree on who should be resigned and who shouldn’t. The
general consensus always seems to be that  if a quarterback was able to show any
semblance of success during their rookie deal, they should be brought back at
any cost as the position is viewed as incredibly difficult to draft. It is this
way of thinking that sees both Super Bowl winner Patrick Mahomes and
yet-to-be-a-playoff-winner Kyler Murray receive mega deals just a few years into
their rookie deals. As this study sheds further insight and clarity into the
quarterback drafting process, it is also time to rid the NFL of this archaic
resigning practice, increase the turnover of quarterbacks, and play to win
Super Bowls, not playoff games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=498 height=421
id="Picture 7"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image008.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The above graph shows how many
years it took a quarterback to win a Super Bowl (1-indexed), adjusted via two
considerations:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A player’s
year count is reset back to 1 when they switch teams.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A player’s
year count only begins upon their first year of starting; years where a
quarterback was not their team’s primary starter do not count towards the
players total.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the immediate observations you will make about this
graph is that half of the quarterbacks who have won a Super Bowl since 2000
have done so in their first two years as a starter for their team. Perhaps more
important, every one of these quarterbacks one a Super Bowl in their first five
years of starting, which is also, coincidentally, the length of a first-round
rookie’s contract. The only exception to that rule is Peyton Manning, and thus
such an exception should be aptly named the ‘Peyton Manning exception’. Let’s
explore this finding, as well as the exception, using a real-world example in
Kyler Murray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Murray is an incredibly intriguing
quarterback. His raw athleticism and flashes of greatness make him a fan
favorite and a long-term contract allows managers and coaches alike to score
brownie points in the media and fanbase, particularly when he is playing well.
Concurrently, and much less discussed, those same two traits also make him an
easy scapegoat when he and his team aren’t playing well, taking much of the
pressure off of those same managers and coaches in that tough position. That
being said, his lack of overall success should not be ignored by those in the
Cardinals front office. Regardless of many flashes of greatness Murray has had,
he still has zero playoff wins on just one appearance in three whole years of
playing. Many are quick to blame other factors for Murray’s lack of playoff
success, however, regardless of how many excuses there are and their varying
validity, Murray still has zero playoff wins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The Cardinals are correct in their
decision not to move off of Murray immediately. As aforementioned, he is only
three years into his career. The previously mentioned data suggests that he
still has two more years to achieve success in Arizona before the verdict on
his career there can be made. However, his recently signed five-year extension
keeps Murray in Arizona for an extra half-decade <i>after</i> this period
expires. Assuming Super Bowls is the priority, such an extension so early into
his career should worry the Cardinals, their fans, front office, coaching
staff, players, and most importantly, Murray himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> So where did it go wrong for
Kyler? Kyler Murray was drafted on a team with a first-year coach, which means he
was dropped into an experimental system with no proof of success on the
professional level. Furthermore, following his rookie year, Murray had a
complete overhaul of his wide receiver room. While the players Arizona added
(namely DeAndre Hopkins) were undoubtably more talented than his previous wide
receiver core, Murray still had to spend an entire second year developing
chemistry with new wide receivers, when that same chemistry should have been
developed in his rookie season. In fact, while most young quarterbacks are
offered some stability, Murray’s top targets have consistently changed
throughout his time in Arizona. For example, Patrick Mahomes could consistently
rely on Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce during his first five years in Kansas
City. In part to such great stability, Mahomes won a Super Bowl. Meanwhile,
Murray is projected to have a fourth most-targeted-receiver in his fourth
season due to the loss of Christian Kirk (2021 Cardinals most targeted
receiver), suspension of DeAndre Hopkins (2020), and retirement of Larry
Fitzgerald (2019). A third reason for Murray’s Arizona short comings could be
his 2021 injury, which sidelined him for three games and seemingly ended an
impressive stretch of his.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>While none of the aforementioned
problems are Murray’s fault, it simply does not matter. The Cardinals have
mismanaged the Kyler Murray era in Arizona and have cost him a great deal of
success in his career. While his extension will allow him to make the money he
deserves, it will not grant him the success he deserves unless he achieves it
first in the next two seasons before his $40 million contract extension kicks
in. Assuming Murray could have gotten the money he deserves elsewhere, the
following chart suggests that he also could have won immediately elsewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=481 height=429
id="Picture 8"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image009.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Above, you will see the same chart
as before, this time with no adjustments. That is, just a pure count of the
number of years in the NFL that it took each championship winning quarterback
of this century to win their first Super Bowl. What this perception of the data
suggests is that older quarterbacks still have value. When used in tandem with
the first chart presented is this section, it is made apparent that it took
Matthew Stafford, for example, 13 years in the league to win his first Super
Bowl, but just one year after changing teams. Similar examples can be seen in
the cases of Drew Brees, Trent Dilfer, and Brad Johnson, who all had Super Bowl
success only after changing squads. Another peculiar case, that of Aaron
Rodgers, suggests that it is also ok to reward extra years for players who do
not start within the first few years of their careers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ultimately, the combination of
these two charts suggest that it would have been entirely possible for Kyler
Murray to have success both financially and in the Super Bowl had he switched
teams.  While there would almost certainly be widespread backlash against the
Cardinals if they were to let Kyler go, they could have traded him just this
offseason, acquired multiple first round picks in exchange, and actually built
a core team worthy of a young super star quarterback rather than panicking and
cobbling together aging stars such as JJ Watt, AJ Green and Zach Ertz, all
while trading draft capital for ‘proven’ talent like Hollywood Brown (who has
surpassed 60 receptions just once in his 3 year career despite being a first
round pick and playing with a former MVP quarterback), and faking a being
championship level team despite not once proving that they are even capable
competitors. From a winning games perspective, it makes little sense for the
Cardinals to have resigned Kyler Murray unless they truly view him as similarly
skilled to Peyton Manning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The Kyler Murray experiment, as
well as many more that will soon see come to pass, will stand as perfect
examples as to why teams should have a high turnover rate at quarterback. We
all know that the quarterback position is the most difficult to draft in all of
sports. That is exactly why teams should be absolutely certain that they are in
a Super Bowl winning position before signing a quarterback to a massive new
deal and losing a large chunk of their available salary for the following half
decade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Ultimately, a few key takeaways can
be made from the two charts presented in this section.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Half of
all Super Bowl winning quarterbacks will win their first Super Bowl for their
team within their first two years of starting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All Super
Bowl winning quarterbacks will win their first Super Bowl for their team within
their first five years of starting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Experienced
quarterbacks should be recycled, but not necessarily reduced or reused. While
it may not make sense for a team to resign a quarterback who has not won a
Super Bowl for them, that same quarterback can be of tremendous value to a
different team.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Peyton
Manning Exception should be observed only when a quarterback is viewed as
similarly talented to Peyton Manning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately, the movement of quarterbacks across the NFL
should be much more fluent than it currently is. The difficulty of finding a
franchise quarterback should encourage teams to have high turnover at the
position, not discourage it. Teams that do not have Super Bowl caliber rosters
should worry more about creating those rosters than finding a superstar
quarterback (Kyler Murray Cardinals), while teams with Super Bowl caliber
rosters should do the opposite and immediately focus on finding that last piece
at quarterback (Matt Stafford Rams).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:200%'>Drafting
Around Your quarterback</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Oftentimes talk around young quarterbacks also
revolves around their supporting cast. When discussing the NFL success of
quarterbacks in their early years, the talent levels of their offensive lines,
weaponry corps, and defense are typically a large part of the debate. That
being said, is there a recipe to properly acquiring talent around a young NFL
quarterback? How can a front office best approach building a surrounding cast
capable of winning a Super Bowl with their young quarterback?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=552 height=371 id="Picture 9"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image010.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The above graph shows the draft capital spent by
teams before drafting a future Super Bowl winning quarterback. The range spans
five years, including the year that the quarterback himself was drafted. For
example, Pat Mahomes was drafted in 2017. Therefore, the Chiefs draft picks
represented in this chart are from the years 2013-2017, a five-year range. Five
years was the chosen span as it is the length of a first-round rookie’s
contract. Furthermore, only quarterbacks who won the Super Bowl on their drafted
team are considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=567 height=379 id="Picture 10"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image011.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=580 height=385 id="Picture 11"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image012.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Further breaking down of this data allows us to
gage the perceived importance of each position. The blue chart above shows
where major draft capital (rounds 1-3) was spent in that same five-year span,
while the purple chart allows us the same look at minor draft capital (rounds
4-7). An important trend shown in the blue chart is that teams will often
reinforce their offensive line and secondary prior to drafting a future Super
Bowl winning quarterback. The need for top tier offensive linemen is apparent
and was showcased during the rookie season of Joe Burrow, where a questionable
offensive line led to him getting seriously hurt. The urgency to build a
secondary is more curious as pass rush is often viewed as the most important part
of a modern defense. That being said, the influx of major draft capital spent
on defensive backs in preparation for a Super Bowl winning quarterback is
slightly more curious. The outlier here could simply be because the defensive
back position includes both safeties and corner backs, but will likely require
further research to confirm. Both the green and purple charts also showcase an
overwhelming number of defensive backs drafted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Also worth noting is the number of offensive
weapons picked in the later rounds of these drafts. While the number of
offensive linemen selected actually dipped, despite the number of rounds being
considered increased from 3 to 4 from the blue chart to the purple, the number
of selected running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends all more than
doubled. It appears as if teams are securing the more difficult to draft
positions by picking offensive linemen and defensive backs early, while trying
to hit it big on late round weapons which tend to have a higher late round
success rate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=592 height=422 id="Picture 12"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image013.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The above graph shows how teams
reinforced their quarterbacks through their following five years of draft
picks. For example, Russell Wilson was picked in 2012. Therefore, players
picked by the Seahawks from 2013-2017 are considered. Once again, five years
was chosen as it is the length of a first-round rookie’s contract. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><img width=550 height=372

<p class=MsoNormal>            Further breaking down of this data reveals that Super
Bowl winning teams greatly change their drafting strategy after drafting their
Super Bowl winning quarterback. The biggest change here can be seen in the
teams’ selections of first-round talent. As stated, prior to drafting their
quarterback, most teams focused on selecting offensive line and defensive
backs. While many similar selections are still made post quarterback selection,
the focus has greatly shifted to defensive line and offensive weaponry. While
the number of first-round offensive linemen decreased and the number of
first-round defensive backs stayed the same, the number of first-round running
backs, wide receivers, tight ends, and defensive linemen all increased. Likely
this increase is such due to the nature of those positions, where each of the
four often see its rookie play at a high level immediately, needing little time
to adjust to the NFL lifestyle. While it is no secret that wider revievers are
entering the league more pro ready than ever, this trend has also been seen in
runningbakcs, where first round selections like Najee Harris often have an
immediate impact and third round selections like Alvin Kamara, Kareem Hunt, or
David Montgomery have proven that mid round picks can do it too if given an
opportunity. Concurrently, recent tight end selections such as Kyle Pitts or
Pat Freiermuth have proven similar ideals about their own position while
players like Myles Garrett and Max Crosby prove that edge rushers can be found
to have an immediate impact all around the draft as well. In an attempt to
showcase the altering draft strategies in an easier manner, here is their
percent changes by position in both the major and minor draft capital
categories:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=572 height=311 id="Picture 15"

src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image017.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The changes in draft strategy presented by
theses charts are important. Not only do teams that alter their draft
strategies win, but those who stick to their old ways lose. Below are the
changes in draft strategies for teams who draft a quarterback and do not win a
Super Bowl with him:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=567 height=294 id="Picture 18"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image018.png"><img

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the largest non-special teams or quarterback
change presented in these charts sits at just seven percent. By not altering
their draft strategy, front offices are putting their young quarterbacks at a
disadvantage. All things considered, the following conclusions can be taken
from this section:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Teams
should focus on building from the trenches outward on offense, and the
secondary inward on defense. Protecting one’s quarterback while figuring out
others are two important talents that take time to develop.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
plug-and-play positions should be drafted after a quarterback as been selected
to free cap space and fill out a roster.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A change
in draft strategy is necessary after a quarterback is drafted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately, the importance of hitting in the draft cannot be
understated. The draft is the best way to find cheap and valuable talent in the
NFL. While many different strategies can be used to determine which players
best fit a team’s system, positional value should be heavily considered and
where a team is located in the quarterback finding process should play into
that value system heavily. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:200%'>Quick
Graphs</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            There are too many factors to be considered in
quarterback drafting. Unfortunately, not all of them can be fit in to one
research paper. That being said, a ‘lightning round’ of sorts can be used to
collect some extra, less detailed information about the draft process as a
whole. Below are some charts that explore that idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=539 height=370 id="Picture 16"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image020.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The above chart uses the previously utilized
WCAV metric to measure the success of quarterbacks selected at different points
in the draft. The color of the dots represents the round in which the player
was selected. While the highest tier of quarterback is typically a first-round
selection, it is certainly not unheard of to hit on a mid or late round
quarterback. Perhaps more pressing, it is also far from a guarantee to hit on a
quarterback that is drafted early.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=553 height=385 id="Picture 20"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image021.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In tandem with the histogram used in the
“Scouting quarterbacks by Scouting wide receivers” section, the above chart
looks at if a team can measure a quarterback’s success by looking at the
success of their team as a whole. It’s worth noting that quarterbacks who lead
their team to a final ranking around 10 in college tend to preform the best in
the NFL. Concurrently, quarterbacks selected from unranked teams also tend to
do really well. There is  a severe dry spell from quarterbacks whose college
teams fell into the lower top-25 rankings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=567 height=368 id="Picture 21"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image022.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This chart works in tandem with the chart above
it but shows quarterbacks on the same scale as all other position groups. The
quarterback position easily has the largest range in success. Interestingly,
offensive line and quarterback show similar trends. On the other hand,
quarterback seems to have a nearly opposite trend to that of both wide
receivers and punters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=501 height=359 id="Picture 22"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image023.png"> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The above chart explores the idea that having a
fast quarterback gives you better odds at winning the Super Bowl. The black
dotted line represents the average quarterback 40-yard dash time. You’ll notice
that most of the quarterbacks fall in front of this line, albeit not by much,
giving an advantage to quarterbacks who can move slightly better than average.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=503 height=361 id="Picture 23"
src="The%20Data%20Science%20of%20Quarterback%20Scouting%20-%20Matthew%20Sherman_files/image024.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The above chart explores the idea that
quarterbacks best operate above a certain height. Once again, the black dotted
line represents the average height for a quarterback. There is a very even
spread across the x-axis here, suggesting that the height of a quarterback is
not a good indicator of their future success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:200%'>Conclusion</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The field of data science is new. Some people
fear it and its findings, while most tend to embrace the new era of sports
analysis. The use of data in the NFL will continue to grow regardless, as teams
will begin to find more success as they merge the old manner of scouting with
the new. While the applications of data science in football are certainly
unlimited, the research presented in this paper attempts to present just a
fraction of findings, some more controversial than others, that will be useful
to front offices and couch GMs alike.</p>
