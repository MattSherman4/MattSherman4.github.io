                    <p class="responsiveText"> Graduating from the University of Maryland in December of 2022, 
                        I received my degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and a minor 
                        in Geographic Information Systems. Driven by my passion for 
                        statistics, I take pride in taking on difficult challenges in my fields 
                        of interest, focusing on unique analytical solutions. Through the use of facts, 
                        charts, figures, and outside the box thinking, I believe that any challenge 
                        can be solved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="responsiveText"> Born and raised in Pittsburgh, I am a die-hard fan 
                        of all things black and gold. I enjoy spending my free time with my two dogs, 
                        watching football, chatting with friends, or playing ultimate frisbee. I also 
                        love watching movies and TV, am a big fan of Marvel, and have had a passion 
                        for geography since I was little. As this site continues to grow, you will 
                        see more and more projects from me covering my topics of interest.
